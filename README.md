# Music Genre Prediction AI
This is my first machine learning project where I made an AI model that can predict what genre is a person's favorite by looking at their gender and age.

## Details
In this project I have tried to make an AI and train it to do something for first time. This AI uses `scikit-learn` library that has `Decision Tree` algorithm which I used to make this machine learn (see watcha did here ðŸ˜Ž). The code starts by importing the required libraries then imported the `csv` file. Then I proceeded to split the data for **training** and **testing** which then I used to teach the AI then check the accuracy.

Thanks to **Mosh Hamedani** and his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eh4d6sabA0) for teaching me the basics of machine learning.
